Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: It allows for developers to collaborate on coding projects in an organized manner. It does 
so by using version control which managing changes to code and files and allows for developers to 
revert their code to previous versions if bad changes were made. 

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to the medical field. For example a/b testing can be performed 
to determine if a treatment for a medication is effective or for image analysis to determine if 
someone has cancer.


Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging applies the changes to files made in one branch to those files into current branch. 
It does this by creating a new merge commit in the current branch that is the three way merge 
between the current snapshots of the branches and the common ancestor of the branches so the 
changes since the ancestor can be seen and used in merge. Rebasing is taking all the changes that 
were commited on one branch and replaying them on a different branch. It is useful if you want to 
update the start of your branch to a later commit that happend after you branched out.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: Learning Pandas, data science principles and how to solve problems relating to data. I am 
also interested in learning how to make useful analysis, experiments, learn ML, and get real world 
experience by making a group project that predicts / explains a problem in the world.
